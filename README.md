# LoveSongs--Spotify-Song-Recommender
This project builds a song recommendation system using Spotify song data, leveraging natural language processing and cosine similarity to find and suggest songs based on a given track. The model processes song metadata, creates tags, and recommends similar tracks based on popularity and attributes.
